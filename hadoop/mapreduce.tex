      \textbf{JobClient}
    \item Then it calls the \texttt{submitJob()} on this class

  \item \textbf{Simple verifications on the Job}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Is there an output directory?

    \item Encapsulate its tasks
    \item {\color{red}Bookkeeping} with the tasks' status and progress
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{This is where the scheduling happens}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} performs scheduling by maintaining a
      queue
    \item Queuing disciplines are pluggable
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Compute mappers and reducers}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} retrieves input splits (computed by
      \texttt{JobClient})
    \item Determines the number of Mappers based on the number of
      input splits
    \item Reads the configuration file to set the number of Reducers

  \begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Heartbeat-based mechanism}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{TaskTrackers} periodically send heartbeats to the
      \texttt{JobTracker}
    \item \texttt{TaskTracker} is alive
    \item Heartbeat contains also information on availability of the
      \texttt{TaskTrackers} to execute a task
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} piggybacks a task if
      \texttt{TaskTracker} is available
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Selecting a task}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} first needs to select a job
      (\textit{i.e.} Job scheduling)
    \item \texttt{TaskTrackers} have a fixed number of slots for map
      and reduce tasks
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} gives priority to map tasks ({\color{red}WHY?})
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Data locality}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} is topology aware
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Useful for map tasks
      \item Unused for reduce tasks ({\color{red}WHY?})

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Task Assignment is done, now \texttt{TaskTrackers} can

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Copy the JAR from HDFS
    \item Create a local working directory
    \item Create an instance of \texttt{TaskRunner}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{\texttt{TaskRunner} launches a {\color{red}child} JVM}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item This prevents bugs from stalling the \texttt{TaskTracker}
    \item A new child JVM is created per \texttt{InputSplit}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Can be overridden by specifying JVM Reuse option, which is
        very useful for {\color{red}custom, in-memory, combiners}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Streaming and Pipes}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item User-defined map and reduce methods need not to be in Java
    \item Streaming and Pipes allow C++ or python mappers and reducers
    \item NOTE: this feature is heavily used in industry, with some tricky downsides

      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Fair Scheduler (default in Cloudera)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Every user gets a fair share of the cluster capacity over time
    \item Jobs are placed into pools, one for each user
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Users that submit more jobs have no more resources than others
      \item Can guarantee minimum capacity per pool
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{Capacity Scheduler (heavily used in Yahoo)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Hierarchical queues (mimic an organization)
    \item FIFO scheduling in each queue
    \item Supports priority

    \begin{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item The child JVM reports back to the parent
        \texttt{TaskTracker}
      \item \texttt{TaskTracker} logs the error and marks the

    \item Case 2: Hanging tasks
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{TaskTracker} notices no progress updates (timeout
        = 10 minutes)
      \item \texttt{TaskTracker} kills the child JVM\footnote{With
          streaming, you need to take care of the orphaned process.}
      \end{itemize}
      \end{itemize}
    \item \texttt{JobTracker} is notified of a failed task
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Avoids rescheduling the task on the same
        \texttt{TaskTracker}
      \item If a task fails 4 times, it is not
        re-scheduled\footnote{Exception is made for speculative execution}
